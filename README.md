Myanmar Energy Dispatch Optimization Using Deep-Q Network Reinforcement Learning
Project Overview
This project applies a Deep-Q Network (DQN) Reinforcement Learning approach to optimize the energy dispatch process for Myanmar's energy system. Given the country's energy challenges, including balancing demand, limited resources, and the need for efficient management, this project aims to develop an adaptive solution that minimizes operational costs and maximizes energy reliability through automated, data-driven decision-making.

Motivation
Myanmar’s power sector faces challenges such as limited infrastructure, fluctuating energy demands, and the need for efficient, scalable solutions to allocate resources effectively. By utilizing Deep-Q Network (DQN) reinforcement learning, we seek to model and optimize the energy dispatch decisions to ensure stable and reliable power distribution in Myanmar’s complex grid.

Project Goals
Automate Dispatch Decisions: Implement a Deep-Q Network (DQN) to generate optimal dispatch decisions based on historical and real-time data.
Minimize Operational Costs: Reduce energy costs by efficiently balancing load demands with available resources.
Enhance Grid Reliability: Provide reliable energy supply while handling uncertainties in demand and supply.
Features
Reinforcement Learning Framework: Uses DQN-based RL for decision-making.
Cost Minimization: Focuses on reducing operational and maintenance costs.
Adaptability: Capable of adapting to different levels of demand and resource availability.
Scalability: Easily applicable to various power grids with minor adjustments.
Methodology
The DQN algorithm trains a neural network model to estimate the optimal action-value function in a discrete action space. The main steps include:

Data Collection: Gather historical energy demand and supply data.
Environment Simulation: Model Myanmar's energy dispatch as an environment where the agent (DQN model) interacts.
Reward Function: Define a reward function that penalizes cost and inefficiency.
Training: Train the DQN model to learn the optimal dispatch policy.
Testing & Validation: Evaluate the model on unseen data and optimize hyperparameters for improved performance.
